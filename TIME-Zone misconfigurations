This only displays the misconfigured..

| round((_receipttime - _messagetime)/1000/60/60) as delta
| where !(delta = 0)
| count by delta, _sourceHost, _source, _sourceName 
| order by _source


Or figure out message delay drifts

 | _messagetime - _receipttime as delay | delay/1000/60 as delay_mins | count, avg(delay_mins) by _sourcehost | sort by _count
